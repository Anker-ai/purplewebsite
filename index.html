<h1>Landmarks or Myanmar</h1>

<p>A country that has captivated travellers for centuries, Burma is a mysterious land of ancient pagodas, spectacular ruins and diverse scenery. Many of Burma’s most awe-inspiring monuments are linked to Buddhism, the most famous being Yangon’s Shwedagon Pagoda and the temples of Bagan, however, there are a number of more recent sites equally as astonishing. Trying to narrow down a list is hard, but here are 19 of what we feel are the most incredible landmarks in Burma.</p>

<p>Located in the heart of Yangon, enchanting Shwedagon Pagoda is the most sacred Buddhist site in the country. This shimmering 2,500 year old temple site is covered in over 60 tonnes of gold leaf and was described as ‘a golden mystery’ by writer Rudyard Kipling. The complex houses many shrines, statues and stupas and is at its most picturesque at sunset.</p>

<h2>Inle Lake</h2>

<p>Home to the local Intha people, Inle Lake is famous for its wooden stilt villages, floating crops and fisherman that row in a unique ‘one-legged’ style. Many of the inhabitants continue to make a living from traditional industries such as silk weaving and cheroot making, whilst the small village of Indein is home to a number of 17th century pagodas.</p>
